# Visual Assembly Canvas

![Screenshot of Visual Assembly Canvas](./docs/images/screenshot-1.jpg)

A highly visual assembly editor, infinite canvas for wiring blocks and machines together, bytecode virtual machine runnable natively and on WebAssembly, and a command-line bytecode compiler.

## Logbook

See my journal of design decisions and daily progress in my [digital garden page](https://poom.dev/from-opcodes-to-algorithms).

## Part of the "From Opcodes to Algorithms" project

From Opcodes to Algorithms is my 100-day project to implement the most basic build blocks such as memory management, registers, assembly-like instruction sets, compilers, interpreters, up to data structures, algorithms, all the way up to working programs. Maybe even operating systems and neural networks in the future.Let's build it all from scratch in Rust, building one on top of another!
