# From Opcodes to Algorithms in Rust

An attempt to implement the most basic build blocks such as memory management, registers, assembly opcodes, compilers, interpreters, up to data structures and algorithms, all the way up to working programs.

Let's build it all from scratch in Rust, building one on top of another! For educational purposes, of course.
